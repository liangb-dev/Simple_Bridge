# Simple_Bridge

This project simulates a learning bridge. The program implements forwarding, MAC address learning, and simplified IEEE 802.1D spanning tree 
protocol portions of an Ethernet switch. Rather than running on a physical network, the program is run on multiple processes, each 
emulating a single ethernet switch. 

- The program decodes and encodes Ethernet packets and spanning tree BPDUs. 
- It implements a learning table as well as forwarding. 
- And finally it also implements a spanning tree.
